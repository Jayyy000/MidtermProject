There is a tradition wherein each district is tasked with creating their Tumba houses with banana leaves and bamboo and decorating them with the various statues of the saints and "atang," or food offerings, visited by the tourists. One of the highlights of this tradition is the Tumba Horror House, where Paoaye√±os play their role in scaring the visitors and experiencing the essence of this tradition</p></td>
